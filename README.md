xdg file templates
-----

This repository contains file templates for desktop environments following freedesktop.org's specification. Really these templates can be used with any desktop environment as long as they are installed into the correct location.

Running the `install.sh` script will copy all templates into your user's `~/Template` folder. Be aware it will clobber anything that was present in that directory.

# todo

* Create a Makefile that will install these template in all users home directories.
